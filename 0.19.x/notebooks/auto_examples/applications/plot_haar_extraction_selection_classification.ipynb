        "\n# Face classification using Haar-like feature descriptor\n\nHaar-like feature descriptors were successfully used to implement the first\nreal-time face detector [1]_. Inspired by this application, we propose an\nexample illustrating the extraction, selection, and classification of Haar-like\nfeatures to detect faces vs. non-faces.\n\n## Notes\n\nThis example relies on `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/>`_ for feature\nselection and classification.\n\n## References\n\n..
