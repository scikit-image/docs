        "\n# Butterworth Filters\n\nThe Butterworth filter is implemented in the frequency domain and is designed\nto have no passband or stopband ripple. It can be used in either a lowpass or\nhighpass variant. The ``cutoff_frequency_ratio`` parameter is used to set the\ncutoff frequency as a fraction of the sampling frequency. Given that the\nNyquist frequency is half the sampling frequency, this means that this\nparameter should be a positive floating point value < 0.5. The ``order`` of the\nfilter can be adjusted to control the transition width, with higher values\nleading to a sharper transition between the passband and stopband.\n"
