        "\n# Face classification using Haar-like feature descriptor\n\n\nHaar-like feature descriptors were successfully used to implement the first\nreal-time face detector [1]_. Inspired by this application, we propose an\nexample illustrating the extraction, selection, and classification of Haar-like\nfeatures to detect faces vs. non-faces.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis example relies on scikit-learn to select and classify features.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n..
