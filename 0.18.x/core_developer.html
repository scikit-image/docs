<span id="core-dev"></span><h1>Core Developer Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#core-developer-guide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Welcome, new core developer!  The core team appreciate the quality of
your work, and enjoy working with you; we have therefore invited you
to join us.  Thank you for your numerous contributions to the project
so far.</p>
<p>This document offers guidelines for your new role.  First and
foremost, you should familiarize yourself with the project’s
<a class="reference internal" href="values.html"><span class="doc">mission, vision, and values</span></a>.  When in
doubt, always refer back here.</p>
<p>As a core team member, you gain the responsibility of shepherding
other contributors through the review process; here are some
guidelines.</p>
<div class="section" id="all-contributors-are-treated-the-same">
<h2>All Contributors Are Treated The Same<a class="headerlink" href="#all-contributors-are-treated-the-same" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You now have the ability to push changes directly to the master
branch, but should never do so; instead, continue making pull requests
as before and in accordance with the
<a class="reference internal" href="contribute.html"><span class="doc">general contributor guide</span></a>.</p>
<p>As a core contributor, you gain the ability to merge or approve
other contributors’ pull requests.  Much like nuclear launch keys, it
is a shared power: you must merge <em>only after</em> another core has
approved the pull request, <em>and</em> after you yourself have carefully
reviewed it.  (See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-reviewing"><span class="std std-ref">Reviewing</span></a> and especially
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-understand"><span class="std std-ref">Merge Only Changes You Understand</span></a> below.) To ensure a clean git history,
use GitHub’s <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-a-pull-request#merging-a-pull-request-on-github">Squash and Merge</a>
feature to merge, unless you have a good reason not to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reviewing">
<span id="sec-reviewing"></span><h2>Reviewing<a class="headerlink" href="#reviewing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="how-to-conduct-a-good-review">
<h3>How to Conduct A Good Review<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-conduct-a-good-review" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Always</em> be kind to contributors. Nearly all of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scikit-image</span></code> is
volunteer work, for which we are tremendously grateful. Provide
constructive criticism on ideas and implementations, and remind
yourself of how it felt when your own work was being evaluated as a
novice.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scikit-image</span></code> strongly values mentorship in code review.  New users
often need more handholding, having little to no git
experience. Repeat yourself liberally, and, if you don’t recognize a
contributor, point them to our development guide, or other GitHub
workflow tutorials around the web. Do not assume that they know how
GitHub works (e.g., many don’t realize that adding a commit
automatically updates a pull request). Gentle, polite, kind
encouragement can make the difference between a new core developer and
an abandoned pull request.</p>
<p>When reviewing, focus on the following:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><strong>API:</strong> The API is what users see when they first use
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scikit-image</span></code>. APIs are difficult to change once released, so
should be simple, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional</a> (i.e. not
carry state), consistent with other parts of the library, and
should avoid modifying input variables.  Please familiarize
yourself with the project’s <a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/contribute.html#deprecation-cycle">deprecation policy</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Any new feature should have a gallery
example, that not only illustrates but explains it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The algorithm:</strong> You should understand the code being modified or
added before approving it.  (See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-understand"><span class="std std-ref">Merge Only Changes You Understand</span></a>
below.) Implementations should do what they claim,
and be simple, readable, and efficient.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tests:</strong> All contributions to the library <em>must</em> be tested, and
each added line of code should be covered by at least one test. Good
tests not only execute the code, but explores corner cases.  It is tempting
not to review tests, but please do so.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Other changes may be <em>nitpicky</em>: spelling mistakes, formatting,
etc. Do not ask contributors to make these changes, and instead
make the changes by <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/committing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork">pushing to their branch</a>
or using GitHub’s <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request">suggestion</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request">feature</a>.
(The latter is preferred because it gives the contributor a choice in
whether to accept the changes.)</p>
<p>Our default merge policy is to squash all PR commits into a single
commit. Users who wish to bring the latest changes from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code>
into their branch should be advised to merge, not to rebase.  Even
when merge conflicts arise, don’t ask for a rebase unless you know
that a contributor is experienced with git. Instead, rebase the branch
yourself, force-push to their branch, and advise the contributor on
how to force-pull.  If the contributor is no longer active, you may
take over their branch by submitting a new pull request and closing
the original. In doing so, ensure you communicate that you are not
throwing the contributor’s work away!</p>
<p>Please add a note to a pull request after you push new changes; GitHub
does not send out notifications for these.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="merge-only-changes-you-understand">
<span id="sec-understand"></span><h3>Merge Only Changes You Understand<a class="headerlink" href="#merge-only-changes-you-understand" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Long-term maintainability</em> is an important concern.  Code doesn’t
merely have to <em>work</em>, but should be <em>understood</em> by multiple core
developers.  Changes will have to be made in the future, and the
original contributor may have moved on.</p>
<p>Therefore, <em>do not merge a code change unless you understand it</em>. Ask
for help freely: we have a long history of consulting community
members, or even external developers, for added insight where needed,
and see this as a great learning opportunity.</p>
<p>While we collectively “own” any patches (and bugs!) that become part
of the code base, you are vouching for changes you merge.  Please take
that responsibility seriously.</p>
<p>In practice, if you are the second core developer reviewing and approving a
given pull request, you typically merge it (again, using GitHub’s Squash and
Merge feature) in the wake of your approval. What are the exceptions to this
process? If the pull request has been particularly controversial or the
subject of much debate (e.g., involving API changes), then you would want to
wait a few days before merging. This waiting time gives others a chance to
speak up in case they are not fine with the current state of the pull request.
Another exceptional situation is one where the first approving review happened
a long time ago and many changes have taken place in the meantime.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="closing-issues-and-pull-requests">
<h2>Closing issues and pull requests<a class="headerlink" href="#closing-issues-and-pull-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, an issue must be closed that was not fully resolved. This can be
for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the person behind the original post has not responded to calls for
clarification, and none of the core developers have been able to reproduce
their issue;</p></li>
<li><p>fixing the issue is difficult, and it is deemed too niche a use case to
devote sustained effort or prioritize over other issues; or</p></li>
<li><p>the use case or feature request is something that core developers feel
does not belong in scikit-image,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>among others. Similarly, pull requests sometimes need to be closed without
merging, because:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the pull request implements a niche feature that we consider not worth the
added maintenance burden;</p></li>
<li><p>the pull request implements a useful feature, but requires significant
effort to bring up to scikit-image’s standards, and the original
contributor has moved on, and no other developer can be found to make the
necessary changes; or</p></li>
<li><p>the pull request makes changes that do not align with our values, such as
increasing the code complexity of a function significantly to implement a
marginal speedup,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>among others.</p>
<p>All these may be valid reasons for closing, but we must be wary not to alienate
contributors by closing an issue or pull request without an explanation. When
closing, your message should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>explain clearly how the decision was made to close. This is particularly
important when the decision was made in a community meeting, which does not
have as visible a record as the comments thread on the issue itself;</p></li>
<li><p>thank the contributor(s) for their work; and</p></li>
<li><p>provide a clear path for the contributor or anyone else to appeal the
decision.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These points help ensure that all contributors feel welcome and empowered to
keep contributing, regardless of the outcome of past contributions.</p>

<h2>Inviting New Core Members<a class="headerlink" href="#inviting-new-core-members" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any core member may nominate other contributors to join the core team.
Nominations happen on a private email list,
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:skimage-core&#37;&#52;&#48;python&#46;org">mailto:skimage-core<span>&#64;</span>python<span>&#46;</span>org</a>. As of this writing, there is no hard-and-fast
rule about who can be nominated; at a minimum, they should have: been
part of the project for at least six months, contributed
significant changes of their own, contributed to the discussion and
review of others’ work, and collaborated in a way befitting our
community values.</p>
